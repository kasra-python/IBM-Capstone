# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone
In this capstone project, we will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using several machine learning classification algorithms. The main steps in this project include:

  -Data collection using SpaceX API and Web scraping, Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning prediction

  -Our graphs show that some features of the rocket launches have a correlation with the outcome of the launches, i.e., success or failure. It is also      concluded that both Logistic Regression and SVM may be the best machine learning algorithms to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land          successfully.
