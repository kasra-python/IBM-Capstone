# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone
In this project, we use several machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The main stages of this project are:

- Business understanding and analytical approach.
- Data collection using SpaceX API and Web scraping.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
- Prediction with the help of machine learning.

Our graphs (infographics) show that some features of the rocket launch are related to the outcome of the launches, i.e. success or failure, and finally we will come to the conclusion which machine learning model is our best.
